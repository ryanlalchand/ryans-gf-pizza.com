# ryans-gf-pizza.com

Final project for YSU's Server-side Web Development and Programming course (CSCI 4862). Goal is to create an e-commerce website that allows the user to build a pizza and order for delivery or pickup. Ryan's Gluten Free (GF) Pizza dot com is meant to service the gluten intolerant community in the Greater Youngstown area, as we currently do not have a 100% safe pizza restaurant for those with Celiac Disease or those who are allergic to wheat. As a former pizza delivery driver & cook, I'm following the developer trend of fixing what you know is broken!
